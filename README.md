# Used Cars Price Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a simple analysis of a dataset of used cars to identify the key factors influencing their prices in the second-hand market. The analysis is performed using Python with the help of pandas, numpy, and seaborn for visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset (`used_cars.csv`) includes the following columns:

- `id`
- `url`
- `region`
- `region_url`
- `price`
- `year`
- `manufacturer`
- `model`
- `condition`
- `cylinders`
- `fuel`
- `odometer`
- `title_status`
- `transmission`
- `VIN`
- `drive`
- `size`
- `type`
- `paint_color`
- `image_url`
- `description`
- `county`
- `state`
- `lat`
- `long`
- `posting_date`

## Analysis Steps

1. **Load and Explore Data:**

   - Load the dataset using pandas.
   - Display basic information about the dataset.
   - Select relevant columns for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning:**

   - Handle missing values (dropping or imputing, depending on the context).
   - Convert necessary columns to the appropriate data types.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**

   - Visualize relationships between different variables and the target variable (price).
   - Utilize scatter plots, box plots, etc., to understand patterns.

4. **Insights:**
   - Extract insights into how variables such as year, manufacturer, condition, cylinders, fuel, and odometer influence the price of used cars.
